                  The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some
                  that are premium and require a{" "}

                  access. It will say on each challenge whether they are free or
                  premium, so it's easy to tell the difference.

                  For sure! Our challenges have five different levels of
                  difficulty. We'd recommend starting with the newbie ones. You
                  might also want to start with the HTML & CSS only challenges
                  first. As you build up your skills and confidence, you can
                  take on more complex projects

                  To start a challenge, click the "Start Challenge" button on
                  the challenge page. This will take you to the Challenge Hub,
                  where you can download the starter files, including a README
                  file which will help you get set up. We'd recommend starting
                  with one of our newbie level challenges. You can then work
                  your way up from there.

                  The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in
                  our Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in
                  there, so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a
                  dedicated "help" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can

                  Yes! Our challenges provide professional designs but there are
                  no rules on what tools to use. So feel free to use anything

                  We canâ€™t offer any guarantees, unfortunately. You can showcase
                  your skills and knowledge to recruiters on our Hiring Platform
                  by completing challenges and engaging with the community. This
                  may lead to job opportunities, but it also may not. We still
                  recommend applying for jobs using traditional channels like
                  job boards.
